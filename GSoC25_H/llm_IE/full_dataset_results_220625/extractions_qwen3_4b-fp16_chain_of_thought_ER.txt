104	of the sentence is "दक्षिण भारत	is "प्राधान्य था" (had priority). The object is "परम्परागत चित्रकला". So the triplet would be (दक्षिण भारत	is "परम्परागत चित्रकला". I think that's the main relation here. Let me check again. The sentence is structured as "In southern India

Wait	is "held under the name	is the name. But the sentence says "2010 को... के नाम से सम्पन्न हुआ". So the event (Darsan Parishad) was held in 2010. Alternatively
107	is "2010 को	is "held under the name	is the name. But the sentence is a bit confusing. Let me break it down again. The sentence is: "2010 को ' ' दर्शन -- परिषद् ' ' के नाम से सम्पन्न हुआ ." Breaking it down: "In 2010
107	is the event	is "held under the name	is the name. But the sentence says "2010 को... के नाम से सम्पन्न हुआ". So the event was held in 2010 under the name Darsan Parishad. Therefore
107	. Let me check the example again. In the example	s were "हराकर" (defeated) and "जीता" (won). So the subject was the same for both relations. In this case	is "2010 को" (in 2010). But the sentence also mentions the name "दर्शन -- परिषद्" as the name under which it was held. Wait
107	is the event	is "held under the name	is the name. But the time is 2010. So maybe there are two relations: one between the event and the time (held in 2010

110	. The subject type here is probably a Person or Organization	. The verb here is "बने" (became	here is "तीसरे ब्रिटिश प्रबंधक" which is a Person or Organization. The evidence is "तीसरे ब्रिटिश प्रबंधक" from the sentence. Then
110	here is still "वे" (they	is "won" (जीता). The object is "यूरोपियन कप" (European Cup	is "यूरोपियन कप". The "एकाधिक अवसर पर" (on multiple occasions) is an adverbial phrase modifying the verb "जीता". So the two relations are: (वे
